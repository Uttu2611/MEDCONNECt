A Smart Health Monitoring System

# MEDCONNEC+
## Introduction
Maintaining our health becomes increasingly important as we age. However, traditional health-monitoring technologies have too many limitations. Bulky wearables may be unpleasant and cumbersome, and depending entirely on caregivers for monitoring might result in missing vital signs or medication gaps. Introducing the health monitoring jacket "MEDCONNEC+", a complete game changer in elder healthcare. This innovative garment integrates easily into your daily attire while quietly monitoring crucial health parameters such as ECG,EMG,BP, Pulse Rate and SpO2 in the background. Unlike the bulky wearables, it focuses on comfort and simplicity of usage, making it a natural extension of your wardrobe. The jacket encourages you to take an active part in your own health while also providing caregivers with useful data and communication tools.

## Overview
The health monitoring jacket redefines remote patient care. Unlike bulky wearables, this comfortable garment seamlessly integrates into your wardrobe, discreetly monitoring key health metrics. It goes beyond data collection, enabling secure two-way communication with doctors for personalised care, anytime, anywhere. A connected app translates health data into actionable insights and proactively alerts you of potential concerns. This empowers both patients and caregivers, fostering proactive health management and improved outcomes. 
The project showcased here introduces an innovative solution for the healthcare sector as it utilizes the ECG Sensor Module (AD8232),temperature sensor module, Pulse oximeter module(MAX30102), EMG sensor module (Muscle Sensor V3) and the accelerometer module(ADXL335). Here we will be using the AD8232 ECG module to track the heart vitals by measuring heart's electrical activity, Pulse oximeter is used to keeep a record of the rate of oxygen that is dissolved into the blood also with the measurement of the pulse rate, this connected in a casade manner with the temeprature sensor which is used to sense the changes in body temperature corresponding to the surrounding temerature value, the EMG module i.e, Muscle Sensor V3 module is to track the movement of body muscles which is mailny used to track the body movement of the patients in comma or patients suffering from paralysis and the acclerometer module i.e, ADXL335 is used as fall detection which is used to alert the caretakers if the patient has fall off the bed or the monitoring ecosystem.
